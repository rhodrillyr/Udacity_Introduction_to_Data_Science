**Project 1: Where should you visit if you're on a budget - Seattle or Boston? Let's look at the data.**

Code allowing the analysis of the AirBnb data between Seattle and Boston to determine which destination is the best value for money.

**Installation**

This code has a number of required dependencies which have to be pre-installed to work. They include:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

Also need to download and save the 2016 Seattle AirBnb data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data) and the 2016/2017 Boston AirBnb data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston) from Kaggle.

**Motivation** 

The motivation behind this project was to analyse the trends between the two locations at similar periods to hopefully see if we get better value for our money at one location compared to the other. 

**Files**

Jupyter notebook including the code used to run the analysis: Nanodegree_Course_2.ipynb.

**Usage**

Download data before use as stated in installation instructions. Code is commented and split into clear sections to allow ease of use. All parts should-be self explanatory.

**Author**

All code created by Rhodri Evans.

**Acknowledegments**

Thanks to Kaggle for making this analysis possible by providing the AirBnb data. Thanks to UDACITY for helping me develop my data science skill set.
